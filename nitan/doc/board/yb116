                           HI! Every One

    I'm very glad to announce that my wife, Zhang Jing will come here on
  March 14!

    Here I want to thank our beloved parents and all of our friends for their
  support during these years.

    Due to some problem, I can't write Chinese here, but I'd like to have
  everyone share our happiness. If your computer supports Chinese and has
  MUD installed, please go to: 202.102.104.7 port 5555. At 10:30AM, on Monday
  morning, March 15(USA Pacific time, China, 11:30PM, Monday night, March
  15th), Huihui and Jinger will have their wedding held in this XKX100 MUD.
  Though it's just a game, only though this could I find a little peace in my he
art
  and not so tormented by the regret that I'm now too poor to afford to have a
  elegant REAL wedding with my Jing.

    If you can't  enter the mud, don't worry though, because here there're
  some WebPages designed by me where you can see our deepest love for each
  other. Please enter here.

    Finally, thanks again for visiting my homepage and I'll be very grateful if
  you could pray for our happy and fruitful life.


                                                 Sincerely yours,
                                                    Wenhui Wei


    讓我們都為他們祝福，祈願!!!!
